[raw-ABBREVIATION]: raw url of script on GitHub/Gist/wherever
Append "?raw=1" to a file link to create a link to the raw file (may be GitHub specific).
	That is to say, the following two lines are interchangeable
	[ANCHOR]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/REPO/BRANCH/FILEPATH
	[ANCHOR]: https://github.com/USER/REPO/BRANCH/blob/FILEPATH?raw=1
As explained on <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7653483/github-relative-link-in-markdown-file/7658676>, it should also be possible to create branch-relative links in GitHub README (and other markup) files, simply by only using the path to the file (i.e. replace "https://github.com/USER/REPO/BRANCH/blob/FILEPATH" with "FILEPATH"). This should also work relative to the repository root if prefixed with '/', and relative to the path of the markup file using '../' and './'

[gf-ABBREVIATION]: url of script on GreasyFork

[ou-ABBREVIATION]: url of script on OpenUserJS
